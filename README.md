#DESCRIPTION
The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that enables multiple users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents simultaneously in real-time. Designed to offer a seamless and responsive user experience, the frontend of the application can be developed using modern JavaScript frameworks like React.js , which provide the dynamic interface and live document editing capabilities. Features include auto-save, user presence indicators, and version history, allowing users to track changes and revert to previous document states.
On the backend, technologies like Node.js with Express handle document storage, user authentication, and real-time data synchronization. Real-time collaboration is facilitated through WebSockets, typically implemented using Socket.IO, to broadcast document changes instantly to all connected users. For data storage, the application can leverage MongoDB, ideal for handling document-based data structures, or PostgreSQL if more structured relational data is preferred.
